These directories contain the image files for use in the SAS Guide 
The sas_editor_windows.png and SAS_Linux_initial.png files I did not put
into a directory although one could do so in the future. 

all images in cust_edit, cust_key, inititalize_GNOME, and initialize_KDE are referenced
in the .lyx file and should not be altered unless you know what you are doing. 

The original_pics directory contains the un-doctored images (without any black arrows and such) if you
have a need to want to edit the original images in the future.
