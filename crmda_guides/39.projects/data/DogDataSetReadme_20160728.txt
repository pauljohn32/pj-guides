6. Data Set Description

The dataset was created from data collected for educational purposes and is not associated with a research project. A librarian sent out a survey to collect data about friends’ and colleagues’ dogs. Respondents were asked to complete the survey about their dog and, optionally, include some demographic information about themselves. Respondents were also asked to send two pictures of their dog: one showing the dog seated and one showing the dog standing. The survey was created with Microsoft Word. No specific image format was requested for the pictures. Raw data returned from respondents included responses typed into the survey form in .docx format and pictures of the dogs in multiple image formats, primarily .jpg and .png. The data were processed into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx). Respondents’ names were replaced with assigned ID numbers. Dogs were assigned ID codes made up of the owner’s ID number plus the dog’s breed. Respondents’ personally identifiable information was removed from the survey response forms and replaced by both the owner’s ID number and the dog’s ID code. 

The sample dataset constructed from these data includes the survey form and pictures submitted by each respondent plus the raw and cleaned versions of the spreadsheet used to compile the data into a tabular format. Two versions of the sample dataset are included in this module.
