This is a training exercise to help people understand the
folder structure we use in projects.

It uses a small data example about dogs that the library staff
created, but the main point is not to study dogs.  The main point is
to learn about running a project.

This was originally developed in a separate project repository, here:

git clone git@gitlab.crmda.ku.edu:crmdaprojects/Ticket-698-Project_Setup.git

But now it is part of the larger guides repository.
