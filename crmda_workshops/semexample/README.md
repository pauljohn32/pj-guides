## Welcome. This is the Structural Equation Modeling Example Archive.

If you want to browse the files, click on the left "Files" on the left.

### **Summary**

This is a coherent set of SEM examples estimated with different
Software.  We began with examples in Mplus and have added code for
R and Stata where they are able to estimate the same models.

The data folder includes:
+ a common set of files that are accessed by the programs in the folders Mplus, R, and Stata.
+ Other materials
+ There are workshop notes that correspond to these offerings.

### Outline

Currently, there are 7 worked out, runable examples.

1. Exploratory Factor Analysis

2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis

3. Measurement Invariance

4. Multiple Regression

5. Structural Equation Model

6. Latent Growth Curve

7. Ordinal Item-types

There will be more examples to come.  These examples are linked to
a series of workshops that we offer, but in the Summer Stats Camp 
curriculum and during the school year.

If you would like to look at the files, please open the link
"Repository" that appears toward the top of the Gitlab host page, or
simply browse to https://gitlab.crmda.ku.edu/crmda/semexample/tree/master

# Document Formats

The Mplus collection is prepared in Emacs org mode.  This keeps
the commentary in line with the Mplus code files. There is  an
instruction sheet in the Mplus folder. This was done before
markdown was invented/publicized.  Org mode has many eager
adherents, but it is not extremely widely used among social
scientists.

The R files are written with R markdown, which is similar to 
Emacs org mode.  The org mode files were created before R
markdown existed.
