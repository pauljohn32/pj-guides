* What is horg?
Horg stands for /handling org/, which is a program written in =shell= and =elisp= to
automate a series of actions in =org mode=.

** workflow
1. insert the crmda template; (make sure this is the first step)
   When running this command, you will see a pop up that asks you to direct to the
   directory where the css files are located. Just point it to the right
   direction, everything else will be taken care of.


   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x insert-crmda-template
   #+END_EXAMPLE

2. tangle the source blocks in the org file
   This step will generate the Mplus input file that will be inserted in the
   output section.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x org-babel-tangle ;; or C-c C-v t if you prefer
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3. insert the output section
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x auto-insert-output-section
   #+END_EXAMPLE

4. execute the shell source code block that runs Mplus
   This step will generate the output file that will be referenced in the
   results section.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x auto-execute-shell-mplus-block
   #+END_EXAMPLE

5. insert the results section
   This step will insert a results section to the org file that includes a link
   to the output file we have generated in step 4.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x auto-insert-results-section
   #+END_EXAMPLE

6. export to an html file
   This step will export the org file into a html file.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x org-html-export-to-html ;; or C-e h h if you prefer
   #+END_EXAMPLE

7. If you are lazy like me, I have made all the steps accessible within one
   step.
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     M-x auto-crmda
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** structure
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports results
tree -d ../
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Setup
1. put the =horg= folder anywhere you like.
2. make sure to put the following two lines in your emacs init file.
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path "path_to_horg/scr/")
     (require 'crmda-org)
   #+END_SRC
3. restart your emacs

* Usage
** batch export org files into html files after evaluating the code blocks inside
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./horg_v02.sh
#+END_SRC
* Limitations
