#+TITLE: Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Example - 01-2 Multiple Outcomes

#+INSTITUTE: Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis, University of Kansas
#+SUBTITLE: 
#+ABSTRACT: This guide outlines how to fit a linear regression model using Mplus. The results of the linear model (seven predictors and two outcomes) fitted with Mplus can be compared to the same model fitted with lavaan (see Multiple Linear Regression Example in lavaan - 01). 
#+KEYWORDS: Linear Regression, Multiple Predictors, Multiple Outcomes, Mplus
#+INCLUDE: ../horg/setup/heading

* TITLE Command
This example is for multiple linear regression conducted in Mplus.
#+NAME: TITLE
#+BEGIN_SRC inp :tangle yes
TITLE:
  Example 4 - Multiple Linear Regression - 01-2 Multiple Outcomes
#+END_SRC

* DATA Command
Nothing changes with the data importation. 
#+NAME: DATA
#+BEGIN_SRC inp :tangle yes
DATA:
  FILE IS "../../data/job_placement.csv";
#+END_SRC

* VARIABLE Command
The data are imported the same way as before, but notice the change
under the USEVARIABLES ARE statement. 
#+NAME: VARIABLE
#+BEGIN_SRC inp :tangle yes
VARIABLE:
  NAMES ARE
  id wjcalc wjspl wratspl wratcalc waiscalc waisspl
  edlevel newschl suspend expelled haveld female age;

  USEVARIABLES ARE
  wjspl wjcalc edlevel newschl suspend expelled haveld female age;

  MISSING ARE all(99999);
#+END_SRC

* MODEL Command
The only thing that is new in this example is in the MODEL command.
Here the MLR model is specified with three lines. The ON command tells
Mplus to regress the two outcome variables on the right side onto the
variables on the left side. In this model there are seven variables
used as predictors of wjspl and wjcalc.
#+NAME: MODEL
#+BEGIN_SRC inp :tangle yes
MODEL:
  wjspl ON edlevel newschl suspend expelled haveld female age;
  wjcalc ON edlevel newschl suspend expelled haveld female age;
#+END_SRC

* Run the Model
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output org :exports both
	mplus reg-01-2.inp
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
