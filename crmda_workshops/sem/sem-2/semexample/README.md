# **Summary**

This is a coherent set of SEM examples estimated with different
Software.  We began with examples in Mplus and have added code for
R and Stata where they are able to estimate the same models.

The data folder includes:
+ a common set of files that are accessed by the programs in the folders Mplus, R, and Stata.
+ Other materials
+ There are workshop notes that correspond to these offerings.

# Outline

Currently, there are 6 worked out, runable examples.

1. Exploratory Factor Analysis

2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis

3. Measurement Invariance

4. Multiple Regression

5. Structural Equation Model

6. Latent Growth Curve

There will be more examples to come.  These examples are linked to
a series of workshops that we offer, but in the Summer Stats Camp 
curriculum and during the school year.

If you would like to look at the files, please open the link
