  abstract       = {The first edition of Analysis for Longitudinal Data
                   has become a classic. Describing the statistical models
                   and methods for the analysis of longitudinal data, it
                   covers both the underlying statistical theory of each
                   method, and its application to a range of examples from
                   the agricultural and biomedical sciences. The main
                   topics discussed are design issues, exploratory methods
                   of analysis, linear models for continuous data, general
                   linear models for discrete data, and models and methods
                   for handling data and missing values. Under each
                   heading, worked examples are presented in parallel with
                   the methodological development, and sufficient detail
                   is given to enable the reader to reproduce the author's
                   results using the data-sets as an appendix. This second
                   edition, published for the first time in paperback,
                   provides a thorough and expanded revision of this
                   important text. It includes two new chapters; the first
                   discusses fully parametric models for discrete repeated
                   measures data, and the second explores statistical
                   models for time-dependent predictors.},

                   methods for the analysis of diverse types of data.
                   Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of
                   content and direct relevance to agricultural,
                   biological, health, engineering, and other
                   applications.The authors focus on examining the way a
                   response variable depends on a combination of
                   explanatory variables, treatment, and classification
                   variables. They give particular emphasis to the
                   important case where the dependence occurs through some
                   unknown, linear combination of the explanatory
                   variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to
                   the core of the first edition, including conditional
                   and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations,
                   and models for dispersion effects and components of
                   dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear
                   and related models, log odds-ratio regression models,
                   multinomial response models, inverse linear and related
                   models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model
                   checking-was expanded and incorporates significant
                   revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply
                   a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of
                   probability theory, but for the most part, the book is
                   self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples,
                   plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to
                   researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear

                   of response variables--continuous (normal),

                   number of times some event occurs. Counts of
                   international events are probably the most common, but
                   numerous examples exist in every empirical field of the
                   discipline. The results of the analysis below strongly
                   suggest that the way event counts have been analyzed in
                   hundreds of important political science studies have
                   produced statistically and substantively unreliable
                   results. Misspecification, inefficiency, bias,
                   inconsistency, insufficiency, and other problems result
                   from the unknowing application of two common methods
                   that are without theoretical justification or empirical
                   utility in this type of data. I show that the
                   exponential Poisson regression (EPR) model provides
                   analytically, in large samples, and empirically, in
                   small, finite samples, a far superior model and optimal
                   estimator. I also demonstrate the advantage of this
                   methodology in an application to nineteenth-century
                   party switching in the U.S. Congress. Its use by
                   political scientists is strongly encouraged.},

                   advanced topics related to multilevel analysis. The
                   editors assembled the top minds in the field to address
                   the latest applications of multilevel modeling as well
                   as the specific difficulties and methodological
                   problems that are becoming more common as more
                   complicated models are developed. Each chapter features
                   examples that use actual datasets. These datasets, as
                   well as the code to run the models, are available on
                   the book’s website http://www.hlm-online.com . Each
                   chapter includes an introduction that sets the stage
                   for the material to come and a conclusion. Divided into
                   five sections, the first provides a broad introduction
                   to the field that serves as a framework for
                   understanding the latter chapters. Part 2 focuses on
                   multilevel latent variable modeling including item
                   response theory and mixture modeling. Section 3
                   addresses models used for longitudinal data including
                   growth curve and structural equation modeling. Special
                   estimation problems are examined in section 4 including
                   the difficulties involved in estimating survival
                   analysis, Bayesian estimation, bootstrapping, multiple
                   imputation, and complicated models, including
                   generalized linear models, optimal design in multilevel
                   models, and more. The book’s concluding section
                   focuses on statistical design issues encountered when
                   doing multilevel modeling including nested designs,
                   analyzing cross-classified models, and dyadic data
                   analysis. Intended for methodologists, statisticians,
                   and researchers in a variety of fields including
                   psychology, education, and the social and health
                   sciences, this handbook also serves as an excellent
                   text for graduate and PhD level courses in multilevel
                   modeling. A basic knowledge of multilevel modeling is

                   accessible to researchers and practitioners working
                   with widely different types of data and software in

                   multilevel techniques to their research. Noted as an
                   accessible introduction, the book also includes
                   advanced extensions, making it useful as both an
                   introduction and as a reference to students,
                   researchers, and methodologists. Basic models and
                   examples are discussed in non-technical terms with an
                   emphasis on understanding the methodological and
                   statistical issues involved in using these models. The
                   estimation and interpretation of multilevel models is
                   demonstrated using realistic examples from various
                   disciplines. For example, readers will find data sets
                   on stress in hospitals, GPA scores, survey responses,
                   street safety, epilepsy, divorce, and sociometric
                   scores, to name a few. The data sets are available on
                   the website in SPSS, HLM, MLwiN, LISREL and/or Mplus
                   files. Readers are introduced to both the multilevel
                   regression model and multilevel structural models.
                   Highlights of the second edition include: Two new
                   chapters―one on multilevel models for ordinal and
                   count data (Ch. 7) and another on multilevel survival
                   analysis (Ch. 8). Thoroughly updated chapters on
                   multilevel structural equation modeling that reflect
                   the enormous technical progress of the last few years.
                   The addition of some simpler examples to help the
                   novice, whilst the more complex examples that combine
                   more than one problem have been retained. A new section
                   on multivariate meta-analysis (Ch. 11). Expanded
                   discussions of covariance structures across time and
                   analyzing longitudinal data where no trend is expected.
                   Expanded chapter on the logistic model for dichotomous
                   data and proportions with new estimation methods. An
                   updated website at http://www.joophox.net/ with data
                   sets for all the text examples and up-to-date screen
                   shots and PowerPoint slides for instructors. Ideal for
                   introductory courses on multilevel modeling and/or ones
                   that introduce this topic in some detail taught in a
                   variety of disciplines including: psychology,
                   education, sociology, the health sciences, and
                   business. The advanced extensions also make this a
                   favorite resource for researchers and methodologists in
                   these disciplines. A basic understanding of ANOVA and
                   multiple regression is assumed. The section on
                   multilevel structural equation models assumes a basic
                   understanding of SEM.},

                   modelling, but choosing the optimal number and
                   positions of knots is a complex task. Equidistant knots
                   can be used, but their small and discrete number allows
                   only limited control over smoothness and fit. We

Currently, many SEM practitioners are having difficulty articulating the causal content of SEM and are seeking foundational answers. Recent developments in the areas of graphical models and the logic of causality show potential for alleviating such difficulties and, thus, revitalizing structural equations as the primary language of causal modeling. This article summarizes several of these developments, including the prediction of vanishing partial correlations, model testing, model equivalence, parametric and nonparametric identifiability, control of confounding, and covariate selection. These developments clarify the causal and statistical components of SEMs and the role of SEM in the empirical sciences.},

Path analysis and structural equation modelling require the researchers to build up their models carefully by explicitly formulating the causal relationships amongst the outcomes, exposures and confounders. Path diagrams used by many SEM software packages as the means for model building are a very useful tool for causal thinking. In this chapter, we will use a few examples to illustrate how to develop statistical models within the framework of SEM and how to test causal relationships amongst variables within those models.},

	abstract = {Missing data (a) reside at three missing data levels of analysis (item-, construct-, and person-level), (b) arise from three missing data mechanisms (missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random) that range from completely random to systematic missingness, (c) can engender two missing data problems (biased parameter estimates and inaccurate hypothesis tests/inaccurate standard errors/low power), and (d) mandate a choice from among several missing data treatments (listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, single imputation, maximum likelihood, and multiple imputation). Whereas all missing data treatments are imperfect and are rooted in particular statistical assumptions, some missing data treatments are worse than others, on average (i.e., they lead to more bias in parameter estimates and less accurate hypothesis tests). Social scientists still routinely choose the more biased and error-prone techniques (listwise and pairwise deletion), likely due to poor familiarity with and misconceptions about the less biased/less error-prone techniques (maximum likelihood and multiple imputation). The current user-friendly review provides five easy-to-understand practical guidelines, with the goal of reducing missing data bias and error in the reporting of research results. Syntax is provided for correlation, multiple regression, and structural equation modeling with missing data.},

	abstract = {Several test statistics for covariance structure models derived from the normal theory likelihood ratio are studied. These statistics are robust to certain violations of the multivariate normality assumption underlying the classical method. In order to explicitly model the behavior of these statistics, two new classes of nonnormal distributions are defined and their fourth-order moment matrices are obtained. These nonnormal distributions can be used as alternatives to elliptical symmetric distributions in the study of the robustness of a multivariate statistical method. Conditions for the validity of the statistics under the two classes of nonnormal distributions are given. Some commonly used models are considered as examples to verify our conditions under each class of nonnormal distributions. It is shown that these statistics are valid under much wider classes of distributions than previously assumed. The theory also provides an explanation for previously reported Monte-Carlo results on some of the statistics.},
