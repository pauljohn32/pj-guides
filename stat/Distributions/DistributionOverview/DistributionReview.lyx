\begin_layout Standard
I have to be a little bit careful in describing this figure.
 The curve represents probabilities, but what does that mean? At the current
 time, my best answer is this.
 Draw one person's name from a hat (all names equally likely).
 Without any additional information, the curve tells me that the most likely
 score is approximately 70.
 Scores below 70 are less likely, but if we consider 80 and above, the most
 likely score is 90.
 These beliefs reflect my experience as a teacher.
 My class tends to have one big clump of solid C students and an smaller,
 well defined clump of students for whom the average is A-.
 When those two groups are combined, a

Maybe you want to re-draw these answers.
 I don't mind.
 Beliefs are likely to vary.
 The key idea is that we can use models, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

probability distributions,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to describe our expectations.
 They specify the range of observations and the chances that various scores
 will be observed.

I suppose you'll nag me for more information.
 This semester, the average on the first test was 78.3.

 I have tenure now, and I expect to impose myself on the students for about
 100 more years, so you can wait and give your answer later, if you want
 to.
 I'll forward the data to you.

I think the average is most likely to be 78, and I'm very confident it will
 be in a range from 74 to 82.
 There's still a chance it might be more extreme, but I'm pretty doubtful.
 This distribution has one hump.
 I've not drawn it that way by mistake.
 It seems that when we average the scores of a class, we smooth out the
 bumps of the score distribution.
 The distribution of the means is simpler.

In my mind, the average number of escapes is 0.84.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second set of challenges is somewhat more abstract, but to me, problems
 of this type are more satisfying and interesting.
 They ask us to describe the range of outcomes we might observe across a
 series of experiments, 
\emph on
even if we do not actually conduct the experiments!
\emph default
 If you want to wait until I'm 150 years old, or until you have lived next
 to the same neighbor for 100 years, you can have an exhaustive set of data
 and revise your estimates.
 It will be pretty boring, and, to the surprise of most people, it is not
 necessary.
 This latter type of reasoning--imagining the variation of estimates that
 would arise--is the most important part of statistics.
 It is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inferential statistics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 From a set of observations, we can make statements not only about summary
 values like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

means,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but we can also summarize our uncertainty about those estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Key Terms: population and random variable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a problem with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

population.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ordinary people use that to refer to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all the people who are alive,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but statisticians usually mean something different.
 Quite often, statisticians use the term population to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

something from which observations are drawn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the conclusions they draw about that process are thought to characterize
 the process that generates observations, rather than simply describing
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all of the people.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To differentiate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

population as process
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

population as finite collection
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 usages of the term, some will refer to former as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

superpopulation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That term is not widely used in applied statistics, but statisticians do
 use it when they are trying to be very clear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time, when we are talking about statistics, we are not talking
 about estimating features of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the people
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the fish in the river
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or whatever), instead we want to characterize the process that governs
 the creation of data.
 If we were studying a finite population, all of our conclusions would be
 instantly out of date when research is reported, since members of that
 finite population will have died or otherwise exited.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we study the population (the superpopulation), researchers usually
 have in mind a bigger meaning:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
population - process that generates observations.
 This has the same meaning as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stochastic process
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We seek to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

characterize
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a population by a mathematical formula, an equation that depends on some
 important coefficients we call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parameters.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
parameter: adjustable characteristic that alters the qualities of a probability
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our goal in probability analysis is to write down a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mathematical model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that we can understand, and then investigate its properties.
 We usually do that by imagining how predictable observations from that
 process might be.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
random
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

variable - an observation--a number--drawn from population (a score 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pulled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from a random process that is thought to be governed by mathematical laws).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have a pretty good understanding of the theoretical properties,
 then we might try to translate them into a study of observations from out
 there in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real world.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We wonder, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do those 
\emph on
things
\emph default
 we observe 
\emph on
out there
\emph default
 come from a process that resembles the theory that we explore in our minds?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: Rolling dice.
 If I say each side of a die is likely to land facing up with probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

, I don't mean to say I've rolled a million dice and counted.
 I intend to characterize the process itself, not the results on a million
 rolls.
 If I roll the die 50 times and try to re-evaluate the probabilities, I'm
 not trying to estimate the number of 1's I'd get in a sample of 1 million
 rolls.
 Instead, I want to know the chances of a 1 on any given roll of that die.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: Coin flips.
 Imagine a fair coin.
 Each outcome is equally likely: the probability of head is 0.5 and the probabili
ty of a tail is 0.5.
 We have a probability model for that kind of process.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Binomial distribution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 describes the chances of observing a certain number of heads and tails.
 Then we wonder if the referee who administers coin flips before football
 games is a random process of that type.
 If there are 10 games this week, we might collect a string of data, {H,T,H,...}.
 Those ten flips represent a collection of scores from a random process.
 From that sample, we often want to find out if the referee's coin is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fair.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That is, does the data match the theory? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is frequently misunderstood.
 It does not mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equally likely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It means outcomes are generated according to a given probability process.
 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thus means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

patterned unpredictability.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A process would still be called random if there were two outcomes and one
 occurs 'almost all the time.'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Finite Population Interpretation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A competing interpretation of population is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

finite population
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 view.
 I think this is not usually useful in the advanced contexts of statistics,
 but it is frequently taught in elementary statistics courses (even as the
 teacher will usually say, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this is not quite right, but it might help you to get started
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this view, the population is thought of as a fixed collection of things
 from which we draw examples (as if we were blindfolded pulling numbers
 in a BINGO parlor).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an introductory course on probability, almost every student has suffered
 through silly exercises like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
The
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

classic
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

example: Consider an Urn with 1000 balls, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 are red, 
\begin_inset Formula $1000-X$
\end_inset

 are blue.
 From a sample of 20 balls, 6 of which are red, estimate the fraction that
 is red in the population of 1000 balls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps this view could be useful if we could convince ourselves that there
 is a fixed, finite set of things we want to know about.
 But I don't have many Urns full of balls I need to study.
 I'm straining myself to think of a realistic example.
 Consider dental cavities among prison inmates.
 Suppose that no new prisoners are brought in, none are released.
 None of them can die or escape.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

population
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might actually mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

these particular prisoners.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We want to know what fraction of the prisoners have a cavity in the second
 molar on the left lower jaw.
 Our prison is too large to actually check them all, so we have the dentist
 examine some of them.
 From that sample, we might estimate the number of cavities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I often belittle this view, saying its practitioners are mainly interested
 in tedious projects, such as estimating the number of left-handed red heads
 in a Cincinnati.
 There are various weaknesses in the finite population interpretation.
 It is not exactly fatally flawed, but it does make some parts of statistics
 very difficult to understand (in my humble opinion).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is one such example.
 The idea of drawing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

independently and identically distributed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (iid) observations into a sample is not practical within the finite population
 perspective.
 We need iid observations in order to derive almost all of the results in
 inferential statistics and maximum likelihood analysis.
 The observations must be independent so that we can multiply them to calculate
 their joint probability.
 They must be identical so we can act as if they come from the same distribution.
 If we take the finite population approach, it is impossible to draw a sample
 of identically distributed observations because taking one case out of
 the population alters the characteristics of the remaining cases, and the
 next draw will not be statistically identical to the original case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some contexts, one can reach the same conclusion from either perspective.
 Because some sampling ideas are more easily developed with an urn of colored
 balls, that model is still used in elementary statistics.
 In some practical areas of applied statistics, where it is necessary to
 find out how many acres are currently infected with a blight, the finite
 approach is prominent.
 But almost all of the workaday tools of modern research scientists are
 based on the idea that the observations we are studying are drawn from
 a random probability process, rather than a finite collection of things.

 out of 1,000 sets of rolls.
 Now suppose I roll another 1.
 Wow, that's crazy! The multiplication principle says the probability of
 a fair die generating four 1's is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.000771605$
\end_inset

.
 Then I roll another 1! The probability is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0001286$

 A fair die would give me five 1's in a row only about 1 time in 10,000.

Discrete distributions are needed when the process we are considering offers

 In the case of a die, for example we can observe a 3 or a 4, but nothing
 in between.

\begin_layout Section
Continuous Random Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Until now, I made this easy on myself by discussing coins, dice, and Democrats.
 Most of the important distributions we need to work on are not discrete.
 Rather, they are continuous: the outcomes correspond to segments of the
 real number line or the Cartesian plane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With continuous numbers, we might have a temperature of 80, or 90, or any
 number between them.
 Variables like time, the proportion of citizens who call themselves Democrats,
 blood pressure, and so forth, lend themselves much more readily to treatment
 on a mathematical continuum.

 different from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? I hate to bring up bad memories for readers, but do you remember high
 school geometry? When the teacher discussed points and lines, did she say
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a point has no width
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? That seemed wrong.
 It bothered me.
 It seemed obvious that if I drew a dot on the paper, my point did have
 some width.
 With a magnifying glass and a ruler, I could measure it.
 With a microscope, I could even see texture inside the dot.
 That bothered me so much I couldn't pay attention for a whole semester.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the part I did not appreciate.
 When I measured the width of the pencil mark, I was simply mistaken in
 thinking I was measuring a point.
 I was measuring the distance from the outer left edge of the pencil dot
 to the outer right edge of the dot.
 I was not measuring 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a point,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I was measuring the diameter of a region.
 I was measuring the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

distance between two points.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Points play the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

edge markers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and two points mark off a region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same sense that a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point has no width,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a single point has no probability.
 A single point does have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probability density,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 however.
 And, after we understand density, we can make the next step to measure
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

probability
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 between two points (no magnifying glass required).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
PDF: probability density function:
\end_layout

The probability density function (PDF) describes the probability density

 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

probability density
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is somewhat elusive, but I expect it will reveal itself to you before this
 section is finished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the sake of clarity--to keep the continuous density separate from the
 discrete probability model separate in our minds--it is customary to use
 a different letter for the PDF.
 I'll use the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, most of the time.

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $(-\infty,+\infty).$
\end_inset

 Any

\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$

Cumulative Distribution Function

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A point has no width, no probability.
 But the chance of an outcome between 0.001 and 0.002 can be calculated.
 That region might be what we have in mind when we say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but it is a region.
 When we talk about hitting the target in darts or golf, we don't actually
 intend to hit a particular point, we mean a region between two points.
 Finding the chances of an outcome in that region is the main purpose of
 the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
 It helps us to answer questions like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is the chance that the outcome will be greater than 9?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is the chance that the outcome will be between points 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cumulative distribution function is commonly referred to by the capital
 letter of the density function.
 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x^{u})$
\end_inset

 represents the probability that a randomly drawn value from the distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 will be smaller than a target value, 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{u}$
\end_inset

.
 It is the area under 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the possible outcomes (which may be 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$
\end_inset

) up to 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{u}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(x^{u})=\int_{-\infty}^{x^{u}}f(x)dx.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We often refer to the CDF simply as 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

, keeping in mind that the parenthesized value is the upper limit of an
 integral.
 If we use the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for the input variable in 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)$
\end_inset

, then the math teachers will want us to use some other letter for outcomes.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(y)dy.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I call the upper limit 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{u}$
\end_inset

 in order to avoid choosing a new letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A Brief Example: The Uniform Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest PDF is the Uniform probability model, 
\begin_inset Formula $U(a,b)$
\end_inset

, which holds that all of the outcomes between 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are equally likely.
 The PDF is 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a}$
\end_inset

 and the probability that the outcome will fall between any two values,
 say 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{u}$
\end_inset

, is easy to calculate:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Prob(x^{l}<x\leq x^{u})=\int_{x^{l}}^{x^{u}}\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\frac{x^{u}-x^{l}}{b-a}
\]

\end_inset

This is particularly easy if we take the Uniform on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

, because the PDF just 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=1.0.$

\begin_layout Standard
For a continuous distribution, with density 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$

As a result, the expected value of x is often referred to as the

 The expected value of

\begin_inset Formula $E[x^{3}]$

variance
\series default
 of a distribution (or just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

variance

 That is to say, it is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probability weighted sum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the squared differences between outcomes and their expected values.
 Variance is formally defined as a weighted sum of squared deviations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Var[x]=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)\cdot(x-E[x])^{2}\, dx,\label{eq:PopVariance}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which can be rearranged as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Var[x]=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)\cdot x^{2}\, dx-E[x]^{2}=E[x^{2}]-E[x]^{2}.\label{eq:PopVariance2}

Repeat out loud: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

The variance of x equals the expected value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 squared minus the Expected value of

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The variance can be calculated from the first two moments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a discrete distribution, the variance is defined similarly

How are Expected Value and Population Variance different from the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

variance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a Very Important Point: Expected value and population variance are
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theoretical quantities.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 They are characterizations of a probability model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can estimate the expected value and the variance with a sample, but
 should never (never) lose sight of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $E[x]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Var[x]$
\end_inset

 are defined by a probability model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between a sample mean and the expected value is demonstrated
 most easily with a discrete variable.
 Suppose a sample of scores is collected.
 The observed frequencies, the counts for outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

, would be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
freq(x_{j})=\frac{\#\, of\, observations\, of\, x_{j}}{\#\, of\, observations}\label{eq:freq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample average, which is often referred to as 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

, (pronounced 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x bar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), is familiar to us as the sum of observations divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 With discrete data (
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 possible outcomes), the sample average, can also be calculated as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{x}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}freq(x_{j})x_{j}\label{eq:averageWithFreq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The formula for the expected value (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:EV"

\end_inset

) is almost the same, except that the observed 
\begin_inset Formula $freq(x_{j})$
\end_inset

 is replaced by the 
\emph on
true probability
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{j})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the sample variance can be calculated as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{m}freq(x_{j})\cdot(x_{j}-\bar{x})\label{eq:varianceWithFreq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

which is almost the same as the population variance in (

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, I would like to unburden myself by expressing frustration about statistical
 notation.
 In many advanced statistical models, a parameter is given a Greek letter,
 say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, and an estimate calculated from data is differentiated by the addition
 of a hat, as in 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\mu}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 That practice is clear and consistent, but it has not trickled down to
 introductory statistics.
 In introductory statistics, the sample mean is commonly called 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

, even though it would be more meaningfully written as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{E[x]}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Some models will have a parameter, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{x}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{x}$
\end_inset

, that we find is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $E[x]$
\end_inset

.
 In those cases, it is only natural to refer to the sample average as 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\mu_{x}}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\lambda_{x}}$
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, it is quite common to refer to a sample average as 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notation about estimates of variance is even more troublesome.
 The most direct notation for a sample estimate of variance would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{Var[x]}$
\end_inset

, and yet that is almost never done.
 Instead, most authors seize on the fact that in one particular distribution,
 there is a parameter called 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 that determines the distribution's variance.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $Var[x]=\sigma_{x}^{2}$
\end_inset

, one will find all manner of notations to refer to the sample estimate,
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{x}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Before computerized type setting made it convenient to insert symbols above
 characters, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{x}^{2}$
\end_inset

 was expedient.
 Nevertheless, it is much more clear to refer to an estimate as 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{Var[x]}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\sigma_{x}^{2}}$
\end_inset

.

 it follows a probability model? I'm not sure if coins, trees, or social
 events can do math; I'm inclined to think they do not.
 Nevertheless, I also think that the patterns observed in nature can be
 described by mathematical patterns, patterns that we socially construct
 and exchange among ourselves in mathematical language.
 And as we interact with nature, we try to improve our mental models by
 adjusting them.

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$

 I'm afraid this way of talking does confuse my students, but I still do
 it because it is fun, and somehow it exposes our mission.

 On one hand, statisticians have already built a catalog of useful distributions.
 We have pretty good reason to believe that there are 10 or 15

 distributions, functions that active researchers remember by name.
 On the other hand, there is an almost indefinite variety of possible probabilit

 In the late 1980s, I recall seeing a list of about 90 distributions that
 were more or less understandably different.
 In the early 2000s, the list had grown to 130 or so.
 Virtually any distribution can be generalized, distorted, truncated, or
 otherwise varied.

First, begin with the result.
 The expected value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 for an exponential distribution is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E[x]=\frac{1}{\lambda}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is not difficult to derive.
 Begin with the definition in expression (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:EV"

\end_inset

) and insert the exponential:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E[x]=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)\cdot x\, dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}x\, dx.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline

This can be calculated with integration by parts.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 & = & -xe^{-\lambda x}\mid_{0}^{\infty}+\int e^{-\lambda x}\, dx\\
 & = & 0\,-\,0\,+\left(-\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda x}\right)\mid_{0}^{\infty}\\
 & = & lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}-\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda x}+\frac{1}{\lambda}e^{-\lambda0}\\

The variance of the exponential distribution is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Var[x]=\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}
\end{equation}

The easiest way to demonstrate that with elementary tools is by remembering
 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Var[x]=E[x^{2}]-E[x]^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We have already derived 
\begin_inset Formula $E[x]$
\end_inset

, so we just need to solve for
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E[x^{2}]=\int_{0}^{\infty}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}x^{2}\, dx.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The work requires integration by parts, twice.
 When that is finished, we find 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[x^{2}]=\frac{2}{\lambda^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

 and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Var[x]=-\frac{2}{\lambda^{2}}-\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}
\]

This is the single most important distribution in statistics.
 It is uni-modal and symmetric on the real number line.
 It may represent observed variables like IQ scores, while it also plays
 a vital role in the study of sampling distributions.
 When we draw samples over and over and calculate estimates from them, those
 estimates are likely to be normally distributed (this result is known as
 the Central Limit Theorem).

Changes in

 line.
 The two parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

, determine the location and scale of the distribution.
 The probability density function is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(x;\mu,\sigma^{2})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\, e^{-\left(\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)},\,-\infty<x<\infty.

\end_inset

The normalizing constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}$
\end_inset

, is required to assure that the area under the pdf will be 1.0.
 The symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is, of course, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $3.14159\ldots$

 In the literature, one will find the formula re-arranged in various ways,

\[
f(x;\mu,\sigma^{2})=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\, e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}},\,\textnormal{or}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}(x-\mu)^{2}}\label{eq:NormalKernel}

To simplify, set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=1$

 (making this a standard normal distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $N(0,1)$
\end_inset

).
 That leaves us with
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
e^{-\frac{1}{2}x^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

Throw away the fraction from the exponent, since it is a simple scaling
 factor.
 That means the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and its probability density is simple.

The normal distribution has many interesting qualities.
 Although in some ways it is a complicated function, in some ways it is
 very easy to work with.
 No doubt, on the difficult side of the ledger, we have the problem that
 the cumulative distribution function has no workable analytic solution.
 The only way calculate the chances of an outcome between two points is
 by numerical approximation.
 That makes computer programs run more slowly and, unless we are very careful,
 less accurately than they should.

On the easy side of the ledger, however, it is not too hard to calculate
 joint probabilities.
 Consider, for example, the chance that 2 independent observations from

 will be equal to particular values 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 That will be the product of the two densities,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(x_{1};\mu,\sigma^{2})\cdot f(x_{2};\mu,\sigma^{2})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\, e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}(x_{1}-\mu)^{2}}\times\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\, e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}(x_{2}-\mu)^{2}}.

We can group like terms and use the laws of exponents to write this as

When calculating the variance from a sample, many students in introductory

should we divide by

On the other hand, the ML estimator may not be the one the professor wants.
 The expected value of the ML estimator of the variance is not equal to
 the true

 That is, it can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E[\widehat{\sigma^{2}}]=\sigma^{2}-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{N}=\frac{N-1}{N}\sigma^{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The ML estimator is just a bit too small.
 It equals the

true variance
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$

 minus a fraction that depends on

 An unbiased formula for estimating the variance from a sample is

Probability Density Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the beta and the normal, the gamma distribution is a two parameter
 distribution.
 The parameters are often called shape (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

) and scale 
\begin_inset Formula $(\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 I will refer to it as 
\begin_inset Formula $Gamma(\alpha,\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 The PDF is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(x)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{\alpha}}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x/\beta},where\, x\geq0,\mbox{\alpha>0,\beta>0}.\label{eq:GammaPDF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\alpha)$
\end_inset

 is a normalizing constant.
 It is known as the gamma function.
 It can be thought of as an extension of the factorial function to the real
 number line.
 For integers, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\alpha)=(\alpha-1)!$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How would someone ever think of a horrible formula like that? If I were
 just making this up, I would reason as follows.
 Start with the exponential distribution's PDF, in which the essential shape
 is determined by 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-x}$
\end_inset

.
 That is a bit boring and inflexible; it is always smoothly declining from
 left to right.
 To spice that up a bit, multiply by 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\alpha-1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x}\label{eq:GammaFn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$
\end_inset

, this just reproduces the exponential (since 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}=1$
\end_inset

).
 However, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1,$
\end_inset

 the shape changes.
 We have a single-peaked function with a mode in the interior of the domain,
 as illustrated in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 That is why

The gamma distribution seems to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

pop up
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in many contexts.
 Recall that the exponential distribution describes the time we have to
 wait before an event occurs.
 The gamma can be derived as a model for the amount of time we have to wait
 that event to repeat itself several times.
 It makes sense, then, that the gamma distribution with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $Gamma(1,\beta)$
\end_inset

, is identical to the exponential distribution (because we only waited for
 the event one time).
 
\begin_inset Formula $Gamma(2,\beta)$
\end_inset

 would represent the time we wait for two events, and so forth.
 This interpretation can be used to derive the gamma's pdf, but we have
 to be somewhat cautious about the interpretation.
 The shape parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 can take on any real values greater than 0, it is not limited to integers
 like 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

As far as I know, it cannot be further simplified, which means that in order

Beta Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$
\end_inset

, has two parameters which jointly define its shape.
 Like the uniform distribution, the beta distribution is defined on a closed
 interval.
 For simplicity, we consider only the version that is defined on the domain
 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta's parameters can be adjusted to dramatically change its appearance.
 It can be single peaked, skewed, or two peaked.
 Three example beta distributions are presented in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
The two parameters that determine the shape and nature of a beta distribution
 are not so intuitively meaningful as are the parameters for the normal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beta distribution fits into a larger mosaic of probability models, but
 in my experience it has two especially important uses.
 First, it can summarize our beliefs about how likely something is to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

be true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

to occur.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Since the beta's formula is so flexible, it can describe virtually any
 shape that we might subjectively impose in a model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, the beta can be used as an output variable in a regression modeling
 exercise.
 If a dependent variable is a proportion, then it may naturally be interpreted
 as a draw from a beta distribution.
 Predictors are used in an effort to account for the fact that the observed
 proportion is high for some units and low for others.

\begin_layout Subsection
Chi-Squared

\begin_layout Standard
The Chi-Squared distribution depends on only one parameter, which is I will
 refer to by the Greek letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 (pronounced 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nu
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The Chi-Squared may be referred to as 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(\nu)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{\nu}^{2}$
\end_inset

 .
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 represents the probability of a variable that is defined on the interval
 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,\infty)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Chi-Squared distribution is used to describe the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

sum of squared mistakes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mismatches
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between expectation and observation.
 If that sum is very small--close to 0--it means the cumulative mismatch
 between expectations inspired by a model is small.
 In all kinds of regression modeling, we often need to decide if one model
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the data than another.
 The difference between the models usually boils down to a Chi-Squared statistic.

As

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The t distribution was developed to help deal with the following problem.
 Suppose we collect a sample of data and from it we calculate estimates
 of the mean and the variance (and its square root, the standard deviation).
 We want to know if the observed mean is in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

middle range
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of what we expect (close to the expected value) or if it is extreme.
 If we think of this as if it were a 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 statistic (see expression (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Zstatistic"

\end_inset

)), it seems as though we ought to be able to make a comparison, something
 like 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{estimated\, mean-null\, hypothesis}{standard\, deviation\, of\, mean}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

What distribution would that estimate have? Gosset suggested that the result
 is distributed according to his t distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, I need to explain how to calculate the standard deviation
 of the mean.
 Please remember I'm using the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{E[x]}$
\end_inset

 to refer to a sample mean (not the usual symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}$
\end_inset

) and the sample variance is 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{Var[x]}$
\end_inset

.
 The variance of the estimated mean across samples is much smaller than
 the variance itself.
 In fact, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Var[\widehat{E[x]}]=\frac{1}{N}Var(x)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here is how that is derived.
 Collect a sample and calculate the average,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{E[x]}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots+x_{N}}{N}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Apply the variance operator to both sides.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
Var[\widehat{E[x]}] & = & Var\left(\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots+x_{N}}{N}\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{1}{N^{2}}\left(Var(x_{1})+Var(x_{2})+\ldots+Var(x_{N})\right)\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{1}{N^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}Var(x_{i})=\frac{1}{N}Var(x)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thus, the true variance (and its square root, the standard deviation) of
 an estimated mean are known, as long as the true variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 itself is known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, the true variance of

 is not known, and thus we are wrestling with the fact that both the mean
 and the variance must be estimated from the same sample.
 What if we could proceed 
\emph on
as if
\emph default
 the estimated standard deviation of the mean were actually correct? Gosset
 charted out a plan to do just that.
 In his own words, he sought to find the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

standard deviation of the standard deviation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 across samples so as to appreciate the ratio of the estimate to its estimated
 standard deviation.

Today, we think of the problem like this.
 A standard normal variable could be created if we knew the true variance,
 as in
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\widehat{E[x]}-E[x]}{\sqrt{Var[x]/N}}\sim N(0,1)\label{eq:tNumerator}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Don't worry that 
\begin_inset Formula $Var[x]$
\end_inset

 is unknown, we will find a way to cancel it out.
 The ratio of the estimated variance to true variance is proportional to
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 variable with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=N$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\widehat{Var[x]}}{Var[x]}\sim\frac{1}{N}\chi^{2}(N)\label{eq:tDenominator}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Divide (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

The unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $Var[x]$
\end_inset

 disappears, and we are left with exactly the result we were looking for.
 It looks like a 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$

Like most of the other distributions that have been discussed here, there
 is no simple closed form with which to calculate the cdf of a t statistic.
 Because the cumulative probability of a

 a table against which test values can be compared.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One complication worth mentioning about the cdf is that the

\end_inset

 distribution is usually thought of as a two-tailed distribution.
 That is, the sample estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{E[x]}$
\end_inset

 may be grossly wrong on the low side, or on the high side.
 Unlike the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distribution, pictured in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where we look only on the right tail of the distribution for evidence

The t distribution is thus a handy way to find out if the average from a
 sample is out of line with expectations.
 That's important, but not so hugely important as the t distribution would
 become.
 When he popularized Student's t distribution, R.A.
 Fisher proposed the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as a distribution for analysis of a much larger class of problems.
 Basically, any problem in which the sample-based estimate is normally distribut
ed may be compared against the t distribution, as long as we can find a
 standard error to use in the denominator.
 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

t ratio
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 refers generally to the comparison of any estimator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\theta}$

Here is where the F distribution comes from.
 Suppose we begin with the goal of comparing two samples of observations.
 We already know that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+Z_{\nu_{1}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is distributed as a 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

).
 How should we compare that against a second set of observations, one for
 which the sum of squares is 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}(v_{2})$
\end_inset

? So far as I know, there is no known method to compare the difference of
 two 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 statistics, but it is possible to compare their ratio.
 If one sample size, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{1}$
\end_inset

, is significantly larger than the other one, then it seems obvious that
 its sum of squares will be larger, even if the cases are not more widely
 dispersed.
 In order to bring two sums of squares into a comparable state, we must
 divide the 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 distributed sum by the number of scores.
 The test statistic we want to understand is thus a ratio of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

mean squares
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{Sample\,1:\,\,\,(Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+\ldots+Z_{\nu_{1}}^{2})/\nu_{1}}{Sample\,2:\,\,\,(Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+\ldots+Z_{\nu_{2}}^{2})/\nu_{2}}.

 What is the probability that I will get any given number of heads after

 The plot on the left highlights the fact that the outcomes are discrete

 However, I fancy the plot on the right because it fits more closely together
 with the continuous distributions that we have studied so far.

Probability Mass Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Binomial probability mass function is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Prob(k|N,\pi)=\frac{N!}{(N-k)!k!}\pi^{k}(1-\pi)^{N-k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is pretty easy to derive this distribution.
 If there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 independent trials, and we wonder how likely we are to get 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 successes.
 The chance that the first 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 trials will succeed, and the rest will fail, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pi\times\pi\times\{k\, times\}\times(1-\pi)\times(1-\pi)\times\{N-k\, times\}\\
=\pi^{k}(1-\pi)^{N-k}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

That accounts for the second part of the binomial formula, but this is not
 quite done.
 There are many other ways to get 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 successes, and so we have to count all of the possible sequences.
 That's where the prefix comes from.
 It is the binomial coefficient.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N!}{(N-k)!k!}$
\end_inset

 is the number of ways to re-arrange 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 things so that 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 are successes and 
\begin_inset Formula $N-k$
\end_inset

 are not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is large, the binomial distribution is quite similar to a normal distribution.
 Lets consider an example.
 Suppose the chance of having a boy baby is 0.63 for all women in a community.
 If 437 women have babies, what is the probability that there will be 200
 boys?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
Inserting 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 into the previous expression, the chance of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 successes is seen to be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Prob(k|437,0.63)=\frac{437!}{(437-k)!k!}(0.63)^{k}(1-\pi)^{437-k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If we had asked for the probability of 300 boys, we would find:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P(300|437,0.63)=0.0001122501
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I've done some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hunting and pecking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with this distribution to find out which values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 are most likely.
 The outcomes with noticeable chances are between 240 and 310, as indicated
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Binomial-with-N=437"

\end_inset

.
 There is a mathematical proof of the fact that as 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tends to infinity, the discrete probabilities of the binomial are very
 accurately approximated by a normal distribution.
 Of course, as is evident in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Binomial10"

\end_inset

, that approximation will not work when 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is small.

Cumulative Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the big problems with analysis of continuous distributions is that
 the cumulative distribution function cannot be simplified.
 Numerical approximation is required, and there are known problems (and
 solutions) for that.
 When a distribution is discrete, no approximation is required.
 We simply need to calculate a sum.
 
\end_layout

Moments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected value is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E[x]=\pi\cdot N\label{eq:BinomialExpectedValue}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

and the variance is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Var[x]=\pi(1-\pi)N\label{eq:BinomialVariance}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems obvious to me that the expected value this is correct.
 If we flip a coin 10 times and the chance of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

head
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, it seems reasonable to expect 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\cdot10$
\end_inset

 heads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a simple way to demonstrate that.
 Think of the outcome, the number of successes, as a sum of 0's and 1's.
 For instance, the observed sample: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0\ldots,1,0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

is really just a realization of Bernoulli trials, and the number of successes
 is just the sum of those trials, as in
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+\ldots+x_{N-1}+x_{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

statistically independent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 samples of size 1, and each one has probability of success equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 So, considering just one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

event
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in isolation, the chance is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 of observing a 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\pi)$
\end_inset

 chance of observing 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 So the expected value of that one draw is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E[x_{1}]=\pi\cdot1+(1-\pi)\cdot0=\pi
\end{equation}

\end_inset

So of you think of the Binomial as the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of those experiments, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
E[x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots x_{N}] & = & E[x_{1}]+E[x_{2}]+\ldots+E[x_{n}]\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi+\pi+\ldots+\pi\nonumber \\
 & = & N\cdot\pi
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance can be derived similarly.
 Consider just one draw, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

, in isolation.
 Its variance is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
Var[x_{1}] & = & \pi(1-E[x_{1}])^{2}+(1-\pi)(0-E[x_{1}])^{2}\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi(1-\pi)^{2}-(1-\pi)(-\pi)^{2}\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi(1-2\pi+\pi^{2})+\pi^{2}-\pi^{3}\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi-2\pi^{2}+\pi^{3}+\pi^{2}-\pi^{3}\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi-\pi^{2}=\pi(1-\pi)
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The Binomial distribution is a sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of those variables, and they are all statistically independent of each
 other.
 Thus, the law for calculating the variance of a sum of terms applies.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
Var[x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots x_{N}] & = & Var[x_{1}]+Var[x_{2}]+\ldots+Var[x_{N}]\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi(1-\pi)+\pi(1-\pi)+\ldots+\pi(1-\pi)\nonumber \\
 & = & \pi(1-\pi)N
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In statistical modeling research, the most common use of the binomial distributi

logistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probit
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 regression models.
 Suppose we group observations into 5 categories.
 For each category, we collect data on trial conditions (these will act
 as predictors) as well as the outcomes, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 successes out of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}$
\end_inset

 trials (and thus the observed success rate is 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}/N_{i}$
\end_inset

).
 Using the predictors (or whatever other information we have handy), we
 calculate predicted success rates for the 5 groups, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\pi_{3},\pi_{4},\pi_{5})$
\end_inset

.
 For each group, it is necessary to calculate how likely we were to observe
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

 successes, and the sum of those probabilities is the likelihood function.
 We would like to adjust our predictive approach so as to maximize the likelihoo
d, of course.

\begin_layout Subsection
Poisson Distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poisson is a discrete distribution with outcomes in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1,\ldots,\infty$
\end_inset

.
 It is commonly used to describe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

event counts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 A Poisson distribution was used to generate Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PoissonDogEscapes"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Probability Mass Function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Poisson has a single parameter, which is customarily known as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 The probability that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 occurrences in a time-interval is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(x;\lambda)=e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!},\, where\, x\geq0,\lambda>0\label{eq:PoissonPMF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is Euler's constant and 
\begin_inset Formula $x!$
\end_inset

 is the factorial of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $x!=x\cdot(x-1)\cdot\cdots2\cdot1$
\end_inset

).
 This probability model can be derived in several ways.
 The famous French mathematician Simeon Poisson proposed this model in the
 mid 1800s, reasoning as follows.
 Begin with the idea of time passing in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small chunks,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose the chance of one event during that time is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\cdot\Delta t$
\end_inset

 (and, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

 shrinks to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\Delta t$
\end_inset

 approximates the chance of an event more and more closely).
 Assume further that the chance of a second event in a particular chunk
 of time is vanishingly small.
 Then the analysis of some differential equations results in the formula
 proposed in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:PoissonPMF"

\end_inset

).
 Another derivation begins with a binomial distribution, 
\begin_inset Formula $B(N,\pi)$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\pi N$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=N/\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Insert that into the binomial probability mass function, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 grow arbitrary large and let 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 grow smaller.
 Several limits must be calculated, and one finds that when 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is not very large, the Poisson pmf very closely approximates 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\pi,N)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $N\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, when it is difficult to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $B(N,\pi)$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is large, the Poisson model can serve as a reasonable approximation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-\lambda}$
\end_inset

 (same as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/e^{\lambda})$
\end_inset

 is a normalizing constant.
 The kernel of this probability model is simply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!}\label{eq:PoissonKernel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Shifting the index variable from

Comments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Poisson regression became something of a fad in the 1990s.
 Many variables were counts, and a model predicting a mean for each case
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

) is relatively easy to construct.
 By far, the most commonly used predictive model is the exponential form,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=exp(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}z_{i})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a predictor (independent variable).
 The Poisson regression falls into the family of generalized linear models,
 and there are standard routines for calculating estimates of the parameters
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 for any of the models in that class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many data sets, the application of the Poisson model will be somewhat
 wanting because the data will exhibit more dispersion than the model predicts.
 In that case, it is now common to revise the model to include a multiplicative
 random error that is drawn from a 
\begin_inset Formula $Gamma(\alpha,1/\alpha)$
\end_inset

 distribution.
 Call that gamma variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the new model becomes
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{i}=\varepsilon_{i}\times exp(\beta_{o}+\beta_{1}z_{i})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

That generates a model with the same expected value (since 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\varepsilon_{i}]=1$
\end_inset

), but a higher amount of variance.
 The primary reason for using that particular type of random variable is
 that the combined effect of mixing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 and then drawing from 
\begin_inset Formula $Poisson(\lambda_{i})$
\end_inset

 is known to be a variable that has the so-called negative binomial distribution.
 That is distribution has the same expected value, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 but a larger variance.

When I started drafting this essay, I believed there were 10 distributions
 that most applied researchers would have in mind on a day-to-day basis.
 I've discussed 10 distributions, and I think I would like to revise my
 estimate to 14 or 15.
 If I had an infinite amount of time, I would write little reports on (at
 least) the following distributions

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some ways, I feel encouraged by the state of probability modeling.
 Compared to the time when I was in graduate school, when computers were
 inaccessible and there was little understanding of distributions except
 for the normal, t, and F distributions, we have an enormous amount of conceptua
l power at our fingertips.
 Any probability model one can imagine can be brought into use relatively
 easily.
 If one can offer a plausible reason for investigation of that new model,
 then others will probably want to consider variations on the parameters
 and domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a case in point, I would mention the growth of interest in the so-called
 skewed distributions.
 The most prominent is the skew-normal distribution, which is obtained by
 taking the normal pdf, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{i};\mu,\sigma^{2})$
\end_inset

 and multiplying by a skew factor, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 times the cdf of the normal.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
skew-normal\, pdf:\, f(x;\mu,\sigma^{2})\times2\times\int_{-\infty}^{\alpha x}f(t;0,1)dt\cdot
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If the skew factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.0$
\end_inset

, then the skew disappears and this is just the same old normal.
 As far as I can tell, this was skew framework was originally proposed in
 1985 (Azzalini, A.
 (1985).
 "A class of distributions which includes the normal ones".
 Scand.
 J.
 Statist.
 12: 171–178) and there are now proposals for skew versions of most distribution
s (the ones we previously thought were symmetric, such as t).

I am encouraged, but also frightened because it appears to grow more and
 more difficult for part-timers like me to comprehend the magnitude of the
 probability modeling enterprise.

If I were a graduate student, here is where I would start.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, I would probably take three or four more math courses than I took.
 I took calculus for engineering students, linear algebra, and sat in on
 courses in differential equations and mathematical statistics.
 Sitting in is never as good as actually taking the courses, and I've often
 regretted that I did not take the time.
 I never enrolled in real analysis, but I wish I had.
 If you are a student who has already taken these courses, and you think
 you know everything, go find some physicists who do asymptotic distribution
 theory.
 There is plenty more to learn.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, I would explore as many distributions as I could find pre-packaged
 for whatever statistical software is in vogue in the future.
 At one time, that was SAS, now it seems to be S+/R.
 I would try to plot the pdf's and cdf's, explore the sampling distributions
 of their means.
 I'd try to verify the textbook claims about the way in which some function
 of a random variable from one distribution converges to another one.
 I'd write short summaries of the distributions for my use.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, I'd get a copy of an open-source scientific programming library,
 such as the GNU Scientific Library or CERN's COLT, and I would study ways
 to integrate those tools with my preferred statistical modeling tools.
 It seems certain to me that when new statistical distributions appear on
 the scene, they will first be offered in a low-level programming language
 like C, Fortran, or Java, and a familiarity with a scientific programming
 library will facilitate the integration of those new distributions with
 my collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, I'd find a practitioner of Bayesian statistics.
 Even if you don't choose to be a Bayesian, it is still likely that working
 with one of them will help.
 Bayesians are, almost by definition, forced to live in a forest of statistical
 distributions and they need ways to make those distributions work together,
 more or less.
