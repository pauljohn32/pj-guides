<blockquote><b><i><font size="-1"><font color="#990000">Description</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></i></b><font size="-1">The National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) is mandated to "collect and disseminate statistics and other data
related to education in the United States". Specific areas of interest
include the educational, vocational, and personal development of young
people starting with their primary or secondary school years, and following
them as they move into adult roles and responsibilities. To this end, it
has initiated several large scale studies in which a cohort is studied
at regular intervals over several years. The studies attempt to gather
comparable data so that education and labor trends can be studied using
the data from several cohorts. The first of these studies was the National
Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72). The NLS-72
consisted of a cohort of about 19,000 students who were high school seniors
in 1972.</font>
<p><font size="-1">High School and Beyond (HS&amp;B) included two cohorts:
the 1980 senior class, and the 1980 sophomore class. It was designed to
build on NLS-72 by studying high school seniors and by replicating many
survey items. In addition, the sophomore cohort was added so that choices
and changes made between 10</font><sup><font size="-2">th</font></sup><font size="-1">
and 12</font><sup><font size="-2">th</font></sup><font size="-1"> grades could
be tracked. Finally, HS&amp;B added survey items on many life cycle factors,
such as family formation and social participation.</font>
</p><p><b><font size="-1"><i><font color="#990000">Waves/Rounds</font></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b><font size="-1">
Both cohorts were surveyed every two years starting with the Base Year
(BY), 1980 through the 3rd Follow-up (FU3) in 1986. The 1980 sophomore
class was also surveyed again in the 4th Follow-up (FU4) in 1992.</font>

<ul><font size="-1">After the first follow-up survey, high school transcripts
were sought for a probability subsample of nearly 18,500 members of the
1980 sophomore cohort. <font face="Times-Roman">The post-secondary transcript
study was based on the 9,064 sophomore cohort members who reported postsecondary
attendance. (December, 1992 to October, 1993)</font></font>
<p><font face="Times-Roman"><font size="-1">In addition to the main student
file, data files include: Language File, Parent Files, Twin and Sibling
File, Sophomore Teacher Comment File, Friends File, Offering and Enrollments
File, Updated School File, Postsecondary Education transcript file, Sophomore
and Senior Financial Aid files, and Institution Code files.</font></font>
</p><p><b><i><font color="#990000"><font size="-1">Mode of administration</font></font></i></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">Base Year: For both cohorts, group administration of surveys
at school.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">First Follow-up: For the senior cohort, a self-administered
mail-back questionnaire; For the sophomore cohort, group administrations
at school, or off-campus for dropouts, etc.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Second Follow-up: For both cohorts, data were collected
through a self-administered mail-back questionnaire. Packets containing
survey questionnaires, instruction sheets, and incentive payment checks
were sent to sample members.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Third Follow-up: As in the second follow-up survey, data
were collected through mail-back questionnaires; approximately 27,000 packets
of survey materials were mailed to the last known addresses of the sample
members. Contact procedures for nonrespondents remained unchanged from
the previous rounds. Approximately 66% of both samples mailed back their
completed questionnaires; 5% of the seniors and 6% of the sophomores were
interviewed in person; and about 16% of the seniors and 19% of the sophomores
were interviewed by telephone. The survey design again required respondents
interviewed by telephone or in person to use a copy of the questionnaire
during the interview to minimize the bias due to method of administration.
Follow-up interviewing resulted in a completion rate of 88% for the seniors
and 91% for the sophomores.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Fourth Follow-up: Approximately 12,000 packets containing
survey questionnaires, instruction sheets, and incentive payment checks
were sent to sample members during the first week of February 1982. Postcards
with dual messages seeking a quick reply from nonrespondents and thanking
early respondents for their cooperation were mailed during the third week
following the initial mailout. Approximately 75% of the targeted senior
cohort members completed and returned first follow-up questionnaires by
mail. Two weeks later, those who still had not responded were called by
trained telephone interviewers. An additional 19% completed the questionnaires
through either in-person or telephone interviews. Respondents who completed
the questionnaire by telephone were required to have a copy of the questionnaire
in front of them while doing so in order to keep the survey experience
as similar as possible to that of the mail questionnaires. Follow-up interviewing
was halted in mid-July 1982 after a response rate of 94% had been obtained.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#990000"><b><i>Survey lengths</i></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;
In the base year, the students were given 60 minutes to complete surveys
and cognitive tests (sophomore only) were approximately 68 minutes. In
the 1st follow-up, the transfer supplement took approximately 10 minutes
to complete, and the early graduate supplement took 10-15 minutes. For
the fourth follow-up, t<font face="Times-Roman">he average administration
time was 30.6 minutes for the respondent survey.</font></font>
</p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#990000"><b><i>Sample sizes</i></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;
The total number of schools selected for the BY sample was 1,122, from
a frame of 24,725 schools with grades 10 or 12 or both.&nbsp; Over 30,000
sophomores and 28,000 seniors enrolled in 1,015 public and private high
schools across the country participated in the base year survey.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The first follow-up sample consisted of about 30,000 1980
sophomores and 12,000 1980 seniors. It retained the multi-stage, stratified,
and clustered design of the base year sample, and all students who had
been selected for inclusion in the base year survey, whether or not they
actually participated, had a chance of being included in the first follow-up
survey.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Conducted during the spring and summer of 1984, the second
follow-up survey retained probability samples of about 15,000 1980 sophomores
and 12,000 1980 seniors. The sample for the senior cohort was unchanged
from that used for the first follow-up survey, while the sample for the
sophomore cohort was selected from among the 18,500 cases selected in 1982
for the High School Transcripts study. The sample design for the sophomore
cohort was modelled after that used for the first and subsequent follow-ups
of the senior cohort, in that subgroups of special relevance to education
policy formation (high school dropouts from the sophomore cohort, members
of racial and ethnic minorities, those with data from the base year Parents
Survey, those enrolled in postsecondary educational institutions, and so
forth) were retained in the second follow-up with substantially higher
probabilities than others.&nbsp; However, all individuals selected for
the base year survey had a nonzero chance of retention in the second follow-up,
regardless of whether they participated in the base year or first follow-up
surveys.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The senior and sophomore cohort samples for the third
follow-up survey were the same as those used for the second follow-up.
Again, survey activities were initiated for all sample members.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">The fourth follow-up sample of the sophomore cohort contained
the same 15,000 members as</font>
<br><font size="-1">the second and third follow-up surveys, and attempts
were made to contact all but 56 deceased sample members.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">14,670 students were in the sample in all 5 waves.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#990000"><b><i>Incentives</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
Schools were sent reimbursement vouchers to cover the costs of reproducing
student transcripts.&nbsp; During FU1, school leavers were offered monetary
incentives for participation ($5 for filling out the follow-up questionnaire
and $10 for taking the test), and were reimbursed (up to $10) for travel
expenses to and from the survey sites.&nbsp; Respondents from the senior
cohort were sent incentive checks for an unknown amount with the self-administered
mail-back questionnaire during FU1.&nbsp; During subsequent follow-ups
as well,, unknown monetary incentives were sent with self-administered
mail-back questionnaires to all sample members.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#990000"><b><i>Response rates</i></b>&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;
School nonresponse rate for the study was about 30%. Public schools had
higher response rates than private and parochial schools.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Unlike "refusal" schools, nonparticipating students were
not dropped from the sample; they remained eligible for selection into
the follow-up samples. Base year student response rate was 92.8%. FU1 student
response rate was 95.3%. FU2 student response rate was 92.5%. FU3 student
response rate was 90.8%. FU4 student response rate was 86.2%. These response
rates are calculated based on the 14,670 students who were in the sample
for all five study years.&nbsp; Overall, student response rate was 71.8%
(% eligible who participated in ALL five rounds).&nbsp;&nbsp; See table
on page 33 of <i>Fourth Follow-up Methodology Report</i> for the source
of these figures.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">For 4</font><sup><font size="-2">th</font></sup><font size="-1">
follow-up, the highest nonresponse rates occur in the West (16.3%) and
the Northeast (16.1%). The lowest nonresponse rates occur among participants
who had been students in the North Central region (10.9%). Non-response
was positively correlated with urbanization. Students at schools with a
large percentage of Blacks (&gt;=25 %) showed somewhat higher rates of nonresponse
than students at schools with fewer Blacks.&nbsp; Student nonresponse is
also positively correlated with school size.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">For 4</font><sup><font size="-2">th</font></sup><font size="-1">
follow-up, non-response by race: White 10.1%, Black 20.6%, Hispanic 19.4%,
Other/unknown 40.3%; non-response by SES quartile: 9.5% top quartile, 11.7%
middle two, 14.7% lowest, 38.8% of other/unknown. Students who had no postsecondary
education (by the time of the second follow-up) had higher rates of nonresponse
(14.3%) than students with only vocational postsecondary education (9.2%)
or other postsecondary education (8.1%).</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">For the post-secondary transcript study<font face="Times-Roman">
(1992-93) response rates varied by institution type from 50.4% at private,
for-profit institutions to 95.1% at public, 4-year institutions; </font>80.8%
overall. <font face="Times-Roman">The response rate by students reporting
postsecondary attendance was 93.2% (with at least one transcript).</font></font>

<a name="DAS"></a><b><font color="#990000"><font size="-1">Data Analysis
System (DAS)</font></font></b>
<p><font size="-1">The Data Analysis System (DAS) is a Windows software application
that provides public access to NCES survey data. With the DAS, users can
generate tables of percentages, means, or correlation coefficients simply
by choosing the DAS variables (based on survey questionnaire items) that
they would like to appear in a table and indicating what function should
be used. Users specify the information they would like to appear in a table
by creating a table parameter file (TPF) and sending the TPF to the NCES
DAS Web site. The Web site will process the TPF and generate the table
in the form of a PRN file. The PRN file provides the table numbers (usually
percentages of students) and the corresponding standard errors that have
been calculated taking into account the complex sampling procedures used
in the NCES surveys.</font>

</p><p><a name="restricted"></a><b><font color="#990000"><font size="-1">Restricted
data licenses</font></font></b>
</p><p><font size="-1">First, verify whether your organization already has a
restricted data license; and if so, the license number, to whom it was
issued, the purpose of the research, and for which NCES datasets(s) it
is valid. One can find this out from the contact person listed below.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">If your organization does not have a restricted data license
already, you will need to review the procedures described in "<a href="http://www.nces.ed.gov/statprog/rudman">NCES'
Restricted-Use Data Procedures Manual</a>".&nbsp; If your organization
has a valid restricted data license, at the very least you will need to
have it amended to add any additional datasets or to add your name as an
authorized user of the data. Other requirements are described below.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">To obtain a restricted data license (or to amend an existing
license), one must send a letter addressed to the NCES Data Security Office,
formally requesting the data. The mailing address is as follows:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
</p><ul><font size="-1">Data Security Office</font>
<br><font size="-1">Department of Education/NCES/ODC</font>
<br><font size="-1">1990 K Street NW, Room 9061</font>
<br><font size="-1">Washington, D.C. 20006</font></ul>

<p><br><font size="-1">In that letter, you will need to include the following:</font>
</p><ul><font size="-1">1.The license number you wish to amend</font>
<br><font size="-1">2.The name of the dataset(s) you wish to use</font>
<br><font size="-1">3.The purpose for the loan of the data</font>
<br><font size="-1">4.The length of time you will need the data</font>
<br><font size="-1">5.The computer security plan you will follow</font>
<br><font size="-1">6.The list of authorized users</font>
<br><font size="-1">7.An affidavit of nondisclosure for each person, promising
to keep the data completely confidential.</font></ul>

<p><br><font size="-1">If you are amending an existing license and if your
purpose is a continuation of the project that was approved originally,
you may be able to omit (or condense) the abstract of your research design,
but it must be specific enough to justify using the raw data. Similarly,
if you plan to use the same computer(s) as the person(s) who are already
licensed users, you may be able to update the computer security plan previously
approved. Please be sure to follow the computer security plan carefully
as spot site inspections do occur.</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">In the case of postsecondary institutions, only faculty
can serve as the primary project officer. Graduate students may be listed
as authorized users only.&nbsp; For more information, contact:</font>
