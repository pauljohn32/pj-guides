I've wandered into this directory and realize it
must be very confusing to a newcomer because 
I can't understand it very well myself.

If you are just getting started with Sweave and
LyX today, start at document article-1.lyx,
which is 3rd in the list here.

What do we have here?

1. firstTry.lyx is commentary about how we were
running Sweave documents in LyX in the early 2000s.
That's about the time when I wrote the Wiki entry
on the LyX website about how to do that, including
a lot of special fiddling to make this work in
MS Windows.

2. article-0.lyx is a completely blank LyX document,
I wanted to create that so as to compare the the
document changes after activating the Sweave module.

3. article-1.lyx is the bare minimum LyX 2.0.x
Sweave document.

4. article-2.lyx is the fancier document that
uses the more elaborate styling techniques that I've
accumulated over the years.
