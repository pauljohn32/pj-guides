This is a testament to the improvement in LyX during the past 10 years.
 I'm on Lyx 2.0.8 with Ubuntu Linux and the built-in TexLive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Lyx, I choose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
File -> New
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It creates the simplest, unadorned article possible.
 I make sure there is nothing in the preamble, no unusual setttings.
 I've moved my home folder lyx configuration out of the way, started LyX
 from scratch.
 There is absolutely no reason why any other person should have difficulty
 opening this document in LyX and running it.

\begin_layout Section*
Make a Very Minor Document Setup Change
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After getting the new, blank document, I only make one itty bitty change
 in the document setup.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Document -> Modules.
 Find Sweave, hit Add
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Now write some code worth Sweaving
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Come back to the document, hit Control-l, put in the code chunks.
 I think this is the most pleasant way, but some people think it is nicer
 to use the LyX code chunk environment

\begin_layout Section*
Try to understand the different types of files that are generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is that bare-minimum amount of Sweave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But you should still understand it is a LyX file, that gets converted to
 Rnw, which gets converted to LaTeX, which gets converted to PDF.
 The process can fail at any step, sometimes in difficult-to-understand
 ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can ask for individual files out of this sequence, however.
 Here is one way to ask for them explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
File -> Export -> PDF (pdflatex) will export the PDF document, the result
 you want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
File -> Export -> Sweave will create the Rnw document that R will turn into
 TeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
File -> Export -> More Formats -> R/S code will run the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tangle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 process to extract the R code from the Rnw document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
File -> Export -> Latex (pdflatex) will create the LaTeX file that we would
 turn into a PDF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I would like an automated process to achieve steps 1-3, but don't have a
 good way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I usually don't need the tex file from step 4, unless there is a failure
 to compile in the last phase.
 In cases like that, sometimes the only thing you can do is get the LaTeX
 file and inspect it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another thing worth remembering is that while it is running, LyX is using
 a temporary directory to keep track of all of its individual files.
 That directory can be configured in 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tools -> Preferences -> Paths -> Temporary Directory.
 On my system, I have that set as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

/home/pauljohn/tmp/lyxtmp
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 When I get errors, I often go look in there to see what's going wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
If your PDF Fonts Look Horrible, Do This
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On my system, the default LaTeX fonts are horrible when converted to PDF.
 The quick fix for that in Lyx is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Document -> Fonts 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and change to Latin Modern fonts.
 Choose Latin Modern for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Roman
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

SanSerif
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Typewriter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 font selections.
 I think many other fonts will work as well, but I've always been happy
 with Latin Modern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another reason to do this is that it reduces the danger of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

invisible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 characters due to the absence of a symbol from a character set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
If you are Happy with that output, Use it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
I usually want more attractive presentation of the code chunks.
 For that, I use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sweavel.sty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which will be discussed in article-2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
I also make other configuration changes.
 The end result is a template document.
 If you want to learn more about how you can make your own template, I suggest
 you start by reviewing my essay on making a LyX Template.
 In this area of my web page, http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides/Computing-HOWTO/Lat
exAndLyx you should see a folder LyX-article-template.
 In there, I show step-by-step the changes I usually make when beginning
 with a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LyX article document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All of the compiling work R does is off in the temporary directory, so I
 don't have copies of the files it creates while doing this work.
 I ALMOST ALWAYS wish I had the separate pieces of LaTeX markup and the
 graphs in separate files, so I might use them in other presentations or
 documents.
 If you want to see how that's done, move on to article-2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
I really wish there were a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

one button

 solution to export
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The PDF for the Sweaved document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Rnw file 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The R code that is extracted (tangled) from the Rnw document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At one point, I had a LyX script that did it, but after LyX updated, that
 script fails and I've not figured how to make it work.
 Frustrating.
 That means I sometimes forget to export the Rnw file and the R files when
 I export the PDF.
