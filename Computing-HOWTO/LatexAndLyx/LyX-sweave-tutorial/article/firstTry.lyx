\begin_layout Title
Sweave Step One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Paul Johnson
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I use Sweave with a bunch of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

junked up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 settings and a different style called Sweavel.sty (Frank Harrell).
 But I don't want to teach users to do all the details first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user's first step should be to use the bare-bones of Sweave, and then
 possibly later understand the complications.
 So start with the smallest possible Rnw file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Smallest Worthwhile Sweave
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm creating this in LyX 2.0.2, and when I'm finished I'll save it as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firstTry.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and export to Rnw as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firstTry.Rnw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing that the results it generates are not perfect, and there may be
 more details to finalize later.

\begin_layout Standard
This is a bare minimum useful amount of Sweave.
 It calculates some stuff.
 It makes a figure or two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note the output quality of the tilde symbol.

\begin_layout Section*
What To Do With That?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convert from Rnw to tex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convert to pdf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I saved this file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firstTry.lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the firstTry.Rnw.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the R translating functions are put to use.
 How?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In the windows shell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Are you good at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shell,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the terminal where you can run commands? Under Program Files/Accessories,
 find Command box.
 If R.exe is in your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PATH
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this will be easy.
 Open a terminal, navigate to the place where the Rnw file is, and run:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R CMD Sweave firstTry.Rnw
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That generates a tex file, firstTry.tex, and from there you can convert that
 to pdf.
 Many ways are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
pdflatex firstTry.tex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
texi2pdf firstTry.tex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
whatever-latex-script-you-like firstTry.tex
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe the reader is frustrated with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Command Prompt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and does not want to fight with it.
 I don't like the windows shell much either, but I like Unix, this may be
 a matter of taste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to avoid working in the windows shell?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In an R session.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you saved firstTry.Rnw in a folder.
 If you start R and make that same folder your working directory, then in
 the R session, this command will work:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sweave(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firstTry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the reader is alert, the following should be expected.
 Save the trouble of typing that Sweave command by writing a second R script.
 In that same folder, start another R file, say call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

processFirstTry.R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In that file, here's what you need to have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sweave(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firstTry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not necessary to include the Rnw suffix, but it is acceptable to do
 so.

Processing code chunks with options ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 1 : keep.source term verbatim
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 2 : echo keep.source term verbatim (label = c10)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 3 : echo keep.source term verbatim pdf  (label = c20)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

You can now run (pdf)latex on 'firstTry.tex'
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From there, use whatever latex editor or compiler you want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many ways to knit together a script to handle this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
In An 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

IDE
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 like RStudio
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my experience, RStudio is pretty good at finding your LaTeX and R programs
 and it should notice your Rnw file needs to be Sweaved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Internet, I find plenty of websites about how to make Sweave work
 with LaTeX editor programs like TexNic or TexMaker or such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find also miscellaneous advice about using programming editors like Emacs,
 Eclipse, and so forth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In all of these exercises, the challenge is to make sure the R program is
 found so it converts Rnw to tex, and after that some LaTeX processor has
 to convert tex to pdf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Do Your Fonts Look Horrible?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On my system, the default LaTeX fonts are horrible when converted to PDF.
 So the first change make is to use the Latin Modern fonts instead.
 Your Mileage may vary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Final Warning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be ready for hassles when working with Sweave, especially when you are making
 presentations.
 That part is a big hassle.
 I can make it work, but I'm more determined than most people.
 Maybe you are determined too, we can be friends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to make Sweave presentations using LaTeX beamer or such, please
 don't start with LaTeX and Sweave at that stage.
 Work on some article documents first, then fight with beamer later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concerns that you will run into later are discussed in the next step
 in this tutorial, secondTry.
