## Objective: Understand what it means to pass R values into C and
## how the results are given back to us.

## This is a simple elaboration from C Geyer's fine writeup
## http://users.stat.umn.edu/~geyer/rc/

## First, compile the C code:
## Command line: run
## R CMD SHLIB foo.c

## After that, open foo.R and step through line by line.
