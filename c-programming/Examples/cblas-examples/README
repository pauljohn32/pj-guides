Examples of C programs that access the BLAS routines from 
the c interface. Include cblas.h for that.

Note that depending on the linker options, this may actually
use routines from different libraries. I mean, lblas is usually 
pointing to a file like

/usr/lib/libblas.so

which, itself, is not a "real shared library file", but instead
a symbolic link to an implementation in some particular programming package.
Perhaps it points to routines from "ATLAS" (Automatic Tuning Linear Algebra
System" or "GotoBLAS2", or the Intel Math Kernel Library (mkl). The selection
can be trusted to system administrators, usually, unless you want
to test different ones, and then some gcc command line magic is
required to specify which one.
