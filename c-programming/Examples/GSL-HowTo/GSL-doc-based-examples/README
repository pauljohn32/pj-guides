I fixed up the files that start with "example-XYZ.c".

Most of the other examples are from the GSL documentation
or from this OSU website:

http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~ntg/780/gsl_examples/


The only changes I made to the OSU examples related to
compiling these programs with Emacs (the local variables
at the bottom) as well as a few small cosmetic fixes.

Note that programs using GSL can be compiled and then linked, 
as with these two commands:

   gcc -Wall -c program.c
   gcc -o program program.o -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

or one can do the compiling and the linking all at once:

   gcc -Wall -o program program.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
