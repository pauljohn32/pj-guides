Sprintf

Learn it. Love it. Use it instead of asprintf.


Q: How do you make a number into a filename?

A: Use "sprintf ()", a function from C.


Step 1. Declare a "character array" to hold a file name, as in

char filename[10];

This one is 10, you can allocte more for longer file names.

Then use sprintf to set the array's content.  We only refer to the
array's base name, filename.  Suppose I have a variable called
"grpNumber" and I need a character variable "M%d".  Here is what I
would do:

 sprintf (filename,"M%d.png",grpNumber);

Like a printf statement, this fills in the %d with the grpNumber that
follows. And so the value of filename is "M0.png".

I use constructions like this all the time.  For example, in a model
with may agents, I might assign a pixmap to each one with a method
like this:



- _getPolPixmap_: r
{  
  char filename[10];
  //  int space;

  sprintf (filename,"M%d.png",grpNumber);

       polPixmap = [Pixmap createBegin: [self getZone]];
       [polPixmap setDirectory: "/swarm/pixmaps"];
       [polPixmap setFile: filename];
      
       polPixmap= [polPixmap createEnd]; 
       
       [polPixmap setRaster: r];

 printf("GROUP NUMBER IN PIXMAP IS %d and filename is %s:",
                  grpNumber,filename);

return polPixmap;
}

If you didn't use this approach, you'd have to write in the filename, as in 

        [polPixmap setFile: "M0.png"];

or something silly like
