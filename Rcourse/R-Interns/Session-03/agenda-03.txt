1. Review data importation and importance of data INTEGRITY.

Suggest directory structure such as

project
    data
    R
    writeup

Keep data in data as provided by client.

Learn to use relative directory name to access that from the R folder.

"../data/data.csv".

See First-R-03 for more on that.

Prime Directives for Data

      #1. Data Integrity is Paramount

      Clients provide data that we DO NOT directly edit.  All work
      should begin with pristine, unedited data file, or some file you
      previously created that is reproducible EXACTLY from the
      original, pristine file.

      #2. Never make point-and-click changes in anything. They are not
      reproducible.


2. Practice on example files. Make a project folder, make
folder data in there, put this file in there

simple-01.xlsx

Make a directory R, in there create a file that accesses that data.


3. Discuss merging as a "real life" data problem with some examples.


4. Definitions. 

merge may mean "side-to-side" connection of data on same cases

merge may mean "top-to-bottom" stacking of observations on different
cases

merge may mean "one-to-many" matching of "relational" data.


5. Step through examples of merging data

data-merge-1.R

data-merge-2.R


6. Homework: Merge exercise with data to be provided by C. Dowsett
