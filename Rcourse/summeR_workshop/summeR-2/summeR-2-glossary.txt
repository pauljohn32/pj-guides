NROW(): returns number of rows in matrix or data frame.
Sys.time(): Get current time
all.equal(): Are all of these equal, after ignoring rounding error?
as.character(): convert a vector to character values
as.integer(): Converts a vector to integers, can create NAs
as.numeric(): Converts a vector to floating point, can create NAs
barplot(): Creates a barplot from a table
c(): Concatenate (or column vector)
cat(): Print or write object in 'raw' state.
class(): Ask an object for its class. Same as checking attributes()
coef(): Coefficient extractor, behaves differently for object classes
colnames(): Vector of column names from a data.frame
combineLevels(): rockchalk package function to recode a factor
confint(): Confidence intervals from an object
cut(): Creates a categorical variable from a numeric variable by "sections"
data.frame(): Create a data frame
dev.off(): usually used to close output files created from graphics
dir.create(): Create a directory
dir.create.unique(): rockchalk function to create directory, avoid overwrite
dir.exists(): Check if a directory exists
exp(): exponential values in the input, as in exp(x)
factor(): Creates a factor variable
file.copy(): Copy file, possibly recursive directory copy 
file.exists(): Returns true if a file exists
file.path(): Combines strings into an OS compatible path (uses correct slashes)
file.symlink(): Create a symbolic link (not on Windows)
for(): Used to create loops
format(): Controls output of numbers
function(): Creates functions
getwd(): Show the current working direcotry
grep(): GNU regular expression parser--scans strings with regular expressions
grepl(): like grep, but returns TRUE/FALSE data
gsub(): Substitutes characters using GNU regular expressions
head(): Show first elements of an object
hist(): Generate a Histogram
if(): An if logical operator
ifelse(): Used for recoding. If input 1 is TRUE, item 2; else 3.
is.character(): ask if a variable is character strings
is.data.frame(): ask if an object is a data.frame
is.double(): ask if an object is a vector of floating point double-precision values
is.integer(): ask if an object is an integer vector
is.na(): Returns TRUE for missing values, FALSE for others
jitter(): In plotting, adds small noise to x,y coordinates
keyApply(): In kutils, applies a key to a data.frame
keyImport(): In kutils, reads a key from a file
keySave(): Save variable key object in a file
keyTemplate(): In kutils, creates a temporary key that user can edit
keyTemplateStata(): Import a Stata file and create a recode-key
levels(): Ask a factor for its current levels
library(): Interact with the package collection
list(): Create an R list object
list.files(): Show file names in a directory
lm(): Linear model: regression
load(): Import a saved R workspace object
log(): logarithm, defaults to natural log
ls(): list items in workspace
mapvalues(): In plyr, used to recode discrete variables
matrix(): Create a 2-D array of values
mode(): Ask a variable for the mode of storage that is used
model.matrix(): Extract the design matrix from a regression model
names(): Retrieve the names of items in a list
options(): See or set values of the user session, such as number of digits displayed in output.
outreg(): In rockchalk, creates a table of the regression model
pairs(): Create a scatterplot matrix
par(): Set or query graphical parameters
paste(): Combine character values into a longer string. Is vectorized, works with vectors paste(x, y). 
paste0(): Combine character strings, but with no space between items
pdf(): Create output file "device" that subsequent plot commands will draw into
pdf.options(): Used in beginning of script to set defaults
plot(): Generate a plot
plotSlopes(): In rockchalk, plot a regression with interactions
print(): display an object's contents
read.csv(): read.table with arguments customized to csv files
read.dta(): In foreign, imports Stata (up to version 12)
read.table(): Read a data frame from a text file
read.xlsx(): In openxlsx, read an Excel file
readRDS(): Read an R serialization file
rm(): delete objects from the workspace
rnorm(): Generate a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1
round(): Rounds floating points to integers
rownames(): Retrieve vector of row names from matrix or data frame
rpois(): Generate simulated poisson random values
sample(): Random sample from a set, with or without replacement
save(): Creates an RData snapshot of a workspace (many objects)
saveRDS(): Creates an rds file (one object)
seq(): Create a sequence of values
sessionInfo(): Print version information about R
set.seed(): Initialize the internal random number generator
sqrt(): Calculate the square root
str(): Describe the input object
strsplit(): Split a string, creates a list of split items
substr(): Chops a string to a given set of characters
summarize(): In rockchalk, Hmisc, or plyr packages
summary(): R generic to display basic, overall view
table(): Creates cross-tabulation of 1 or more variables
text(): Add text to the plot region
toupper(): Converts characters to UPPER case
vector(): Creates a vector of given mode and length
xtable(): In xtable, this creates an object which can be printed (LaTeX or HTML)
