c(): Concatenate (or column vector)
cbind(): Combine columns
coef(): Retrieve coefficients from an object
cohen.ES(): Effect size estimate
colMeans(): Calculate means of matrix columns. Efficiently.
cor(): Calculate correlation

qnorm(): Quantiles values from a normal distribution
range(): retrieve the low and high values from vector
rbind(): Stack together vectors as rows in a matrix
rbinom(): Simulate values from a binomial distribution
rep(): Repeat first thing, a given number of times
require(): Loads a package, almost same as library()
rnorm(): Generate a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1
round(): Rounds floating points to integers
sapply(): Run lapply, simplify the result.
sd(): Calculate standard deviation. Don't forget na.rm=TRUE
seq(): Create a sequence of values
sessionInfo(): Report on R version and packages in use
set.seed(): Initialize the internal random number generator
sqrt(): Calculate the square root
str(): Describe an R object
