It presents methods for data input and output as well as database interactions. The author also examines different facets of string handling and manipulations, discusses the interfacing of R with other languages, and describes how to write software packages. He concludes with a discussion on the debugging and profiling of R code. With numerous examples and exercises, this practical guide focuses on developing R programming skills in order to tackle problems encountered in bioinformatics and computational biology.},

The bookdown package inherits the simplicity of syntax and flexibility for data analysis from R Markdown, and extends R Markdown for technical writing, so that you can make better use of document elements such as figures, tables, equations, theorems, citations, and references. Similar to LaTeX, you can number and cross-reference these elements with bookdown. Your document can even include live examples so readers can interact with them while reading the book. The book can be rendered to multiple output formats, including LaTeX/PDF, HTML, EPUB, and Word, thus making it easy to put your documents online. The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C++, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported. You can also leave out computing, for example, to write a fiction. This book itself is an example of publishing with bookdown and R Markdown, and its source is fully available on GitHub.},

                   continues to provide a definitive unified, treatment of
                   methods for the analysis of diverse types of data.
                   Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of
                   content and direct relevance to agricultural,
                   biological, health, engineering, and other
                   applications.The authors focus on examining the way a
                   response variable depends on a combination of
                   explanatory variables, treatment, and classification
                   variables. They give particular emphasis to the
                   important case where the dependence occurs through some
                   unknown, linear combination of the explanatory
                   variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to
                   the core of the first edition, including conditional
                   and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations,
                   and models for dispersion effects and components of
                   dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear
                   and related models, log odds-ratio regression models,
                   multinomial response models, inverse linear and related
                   models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model
                   checking-was expanded and incorporates significant
                   revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply
                   a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of
                   probability theory, but for the most part, the book is
                   self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples,
                   plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to
                   researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear

                   statistical models that are used directly in many
                   fields of applications and also are used as iterative
                   steps in fitting other types of mixed-effects models,
                   such as generalized linear mixed models. The parameters
                   in these models are typically estimated by maximum
                   likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In
                   general, there is no closed-form solution for these
                   estimates and they must be determined by iterative
                   algorithms such as EM iterations or general nonlinear
                   optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for
                   such iterations have been expressed as generalized
                   least squares problems. We show that an alternative
                   representation as a penalized least squares problem has
                   many advantageous computational properties including
                   the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled

                   come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such
                   as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The
                   challenge of understanding these data has led to the
                   development of new tools in the field of statistics,
                   and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine

                   common underpinnings but are often expressed with
                   different terminology. This book describes the
                   important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual
                   framework. While the approach is statistical, the
                   emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many

                   various design issues specific to repeated
                   measurements, and on missing data and dropouts.

                   of response variables--continuous (normal),
                   categorical, and count data--and develops a practical

                   ideas on multivariate distributions and stochastic

  abstract       = {\$B\$-splines are attractive for nonparametric
                   modelling, but choosing the optimal number and
                   positions of knots is a complex task. Equidistant knots
                   can be used, but their small and discrete number allows
                   only limited control over smoothness and fit. We
                   propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a
                   difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent
                   \$B\$-splines. We show connections to the familiar
                   spline penalty on the integral of the squared second
                   derivative. A short overview of \$B\$-splines, of their
                   construction and of penalized likelihood is presented.
                   We discuss properties of penalized \$B\$-splines and
                   propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal
                   penalty parameter. Nonparametric logistic regression,
                   density estimation and scatterplot smoothing are used
                   as examples. Some details of the computations are
                   presented.},
