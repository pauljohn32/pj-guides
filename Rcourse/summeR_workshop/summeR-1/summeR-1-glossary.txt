next(): Inside a for loop, this stops processsing of current case
options(): See or set values of the user session, such as number of digits displayed in output.
par(): Set or query graphical parameters
paste(): Combine character values into a longer string. Is vectorized, works with vectors paste(x, y). 
paste0(): Combine character strings, but with no space between items
pdf(): Create output file "device" that subsequent plot commands will draw into
pdf.options(): Used in beginning of script to set defaults

title(): Add a title on the top of a plot (same as main= "" in plot command)
unique(): List all unique values in a vector
update.packages(): Check CRAN for updates and install them, after asking permission
var(): calculate variance
which(): Which elements in a vector are TRUE
windows(): In MS Windows, used to create a graphic display device (a "window")
