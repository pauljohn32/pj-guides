nrow(): Ask for number of rows from a matrix
numeric(): Create a numeric vector
options(): See or set values of the user session, such as number of digits displayed in output.
order(): Receive a vector and return index to represent the ordering of the elements
ordered(): Create an ordered vector
outreg(): regression table maker in rockchalk package
par(): Set or query graphical parameters
paste(): Combine character values into a longer string. Is vectorized, works with vectors paste(x, y). 
paste0(): Combine strings with no space, same as paste(..., sep="")
