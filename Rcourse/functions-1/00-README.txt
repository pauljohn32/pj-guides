I had a big lecture "functions-1". But it was too
long to use in one sitting, it was difficult to find
pieces when I wanted them.

In Fall 2016, I took that lecture and made separate
parts with names of the sections.  In future, I'll go
from that direction, eventually "functions-1" will cease
to exist.
